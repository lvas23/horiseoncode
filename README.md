Horiseons CSS and HTML have mistakes within the code
    Horiseon is a code that I have downloaded from UT Coding bookcamp.

## Updated HTML

    div id="search-engine-otimization" was missing and w ould not redirect when you click on header.

## Updated CSS

On <!--font-family-->
    quotation was missing on 'calibri' and 'arial'
